# REST_Application
Submission for Code Challenge at LifeWay

## Requirements
- [x] Create a REST service with a single endpoint that accepts a json message with two fields.."id" and "message". (example: { "id": "123", "message": "hello world" })
- [ ] The endpoint should return a json document with a single field "count" that contains the total number of words contained in all the messages received to that point.
- [ ] For example, if the first message contains 3 words it would respond with count = 3. If the next message contains 5 words it would respond with count = 8.
- [x] The service should ignore messages with duplicate ids. (i.e. ids that have already been processed)
- [x] Use Java or Kotlin
- [x] Use Spring Boot
- [x] Use the database of your choice to track idâ€™s and counts.
- [ ] Upload all code to a public github repo with a readme that explains how to build and run the project.
