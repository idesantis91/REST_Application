# REST_Application
## Submission for LifeWay Code Challenge
- Thanks for the challenge!
- This was my first Springboot application and I learned alot!

# Build/Run Instructions
- Clone GitHub Repo
- In CMD, CD into target folder (cd REST_Application/rest-service/target/)
- Run java -jar rest-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
- Open localhost:8080/count?id=(enter ID here)&content=(Enter Message here)
- On screen should return count of length of messages recieved to that endpoint  
(Duplicate IDs will be ignored and make the count screen go blank but will reappear after an id with no duplicate has been entered)

## Requirements
- [x] Create a REST service with a single endpoint that accepts a json message with two fields.."id" and "message". (example: { "id": "123", "message": "hello world" })
- [x] The endpoint should return a json document with a single field "count" that contains the total number of words contained in all the messages received to that point.
- [x] For example, if the first message contains 3 words it would respond with count = 3. If the next message contains 5 words it would respond with count = 8.
- [x] The service should ignore messages with duplicate ids. (i.e. ids that have already been processed)
- [x] Use Java or Kotlin
- [x] Use Spring Boot
- [x] Use the database of your choice to track idâ€™s and counts.
- [x] Upload all code to a public github repo with a readme that explains how to build and run the project.
